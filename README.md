# DashDotInputView

This project was created for a CodeSlam where we were challenged to create an app that could take morse code inputs and would translate it to alpha text.

For this challenge I chose to use the screen interactions as input to enter the morse code.
In addition, I decided to insert a metronome so the user could control the speed of each time unit that they would like to use to control the time unit for the morse code.

There are rules to help people distinguish dots from dashes in Morse code.
- The length of a dot is 1 time unit.
- A dash is 3 time units.
- The space between symbols (dots and dashes) of the same letter is 1 time unit.
- The space between letters is 3 time units.
- The space between words is 7 time units.

To give some immersion for the user I tried to create a theme to the screen that would reflect a possible morse code machine on a bunker or old office.
I've used free assets from the internet to create the background and some buttons.

And, the last challenge I decided to tackle was the insertion of a beep sound when entering the Morse Code itself. So it is closer to the real experience.
The support to do it while changing audio state quickly is not the best

All the code was slammed together in three days. 
I didn't have the time to make it cleaner and try to polish some features like the beep sound.
But hey...I think it works!
